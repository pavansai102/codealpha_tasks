📊 Sentiment Analysis using Python

📌 Internship Task – Data Analytics

📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal is to analyze text content and classify it into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments to understand public opinion and emotional trends.

The dataset contains text data along with demographic and country-level information, making it suitable for real-world sentiment analysis applications.


🎯 Objectives

Analyze textual data using NLP

Classify sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Generate insights from unstructured text data

Visualize sentiment distribution

Support decision-making using sentiment patterns

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

TextBlob – Sentiment analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical visualization

📌 Methodology

Load and inspect the dataset

Clean and preprocess text data

Apply TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity

Classify sentiment based on polarity score

Store results in a new column (Predicted_Sentiment)

Visualize sentiment distribution using graphs

🧪 Sentiment Classification Logic

Positive: Polarity > 0

Negative: Polarity < 0

Neutral: Polarity = 0

📊 Visualization

A bar chart is used to display the count of:

Positive sentiments

Negative sentiments

Neutral sentiments

This helps in understanding overall public opinion trends.

✅ Results

Each text entry is labeled with a predicted sentiment

Sentiment distribution is visualized

Dataset is enhanced with sentiment insights

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NLP techniques can be used to extract meaningful insights from text data.
Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer feedback, social media opinions, and market trends.
