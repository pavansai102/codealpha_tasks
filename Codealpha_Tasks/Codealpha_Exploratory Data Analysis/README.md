Student Performance – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Student Performance dataset to understand the factors that influence students’ academic performance.
The analysis uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies in the data.

🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA project are:


To understand the structure and quality of the dataset


To identify key factors affecting student performance


To detect missing values, duplicates, and outliers


To analyze relationships between academic, lifestyle, and performance variables


To validate basic statistical assumptions using visualizations




🛠️ Tools & Libraries


Python


Pandas


NumPy


Matplotlib


Seaborn



🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
1️⃣ Data Understanding


Dataset shape (rows & columns)


Data types and column meanings


Summary statistics


2️⃣ Data Cleaning


Missing value detection


Duplicate row identification


Data consistency checks


3️⃣ Univariate Analysis


Distribution of numerical variables using histograms


Frequency analysis of categorical variables


4️⃣ Outlier Detection


Box plots used to detect extreme values


5️⃣ Bivariate Analysis


Correlation analysis between numerical variables


Group-wise comparison using categorical variables


6️⃣ Hypothesis Testing & Assumption Validation


Mean comparison across categories


Correlation coefficient analysis


Normality and linearity checks using visualizations





📊 Key Insights


Students with extracurricular activities show variation in performance


Sleep hours and previous scores have a noticeable relationship with performance


Outliers are present and can affect modeling results


Data is suitable for further statistical analysis and predictive modeling



🚀 Conclusion
This EDA provides a strong foundation for:


Feature selection


Predictive modeling


Academic performance analysis


The insights gained help understand how study habits and lifestyle factors influence student outcomes.
